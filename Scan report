Short Vulnerability Summary

Total findings: 23
Severity: 1 Medium, 1 Mixed, 21 Informational
Top risk: SMB Signing not required (CVSS 5.3) â€” high priority.
Other clusters: SSL/TLS issues (4), SMB info (6), HTTP (2), Netstat port findings (50 entries), DCE/RPC (8).

Immediate fixes:
1. Enable SMB signing on servers/clients.
2. Enforce TLS 1.2+ / TLS 1.3 and remove weak ciphers.
3. Close/restrict unnecessary ports and services; restrict RPC to trusted networks.

Risk level: Low-to-moderate overall if SMB is remediated; many items are informational but useful for attacker recon.
